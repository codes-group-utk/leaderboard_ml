UniFoil comes with numerous examples to help show how the data is stored, accessed, and utilized.
Unlike typical codebases, our test scripts **test<0-8>.py** (see the `Dataset Check <https://unifoildocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#step-3-dataset-check>`_ section for more details) provide all the example usage the end--user needs.
